Hello, my name is Bennett Carter!

I am a aspiring programmer who is learning about full stack development in their spare time. My main focus is currently Javascript, HTML, CSS, and React. I currently work as a CRM Administrator but I am expanding my skillset with the goal of shifting towards a full time position involved with coding.

I grew up in Houston and now live in San Antonio, TX. I moved here after graduating from Trinity University, where I acquired my bachelors degree in Mathematics. My main hobbies aside from coding are gaming and spending time with my long term girlfriend Grace.

This GitHub page consists of projects I have worked on to hone my coding skills.
